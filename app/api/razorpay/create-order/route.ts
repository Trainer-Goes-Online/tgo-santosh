/**
 * Creates the Razorpay order the browser then pays.
 *
 * Called with the Razorpay REST API over fetch rather than the `razorpay` npm
 * package: order creation is one authenticated POST, and avoiding the package
 * keeps a dependency (and its transitive tree) out of this project.
 *
 * THE NOTES ARE THE POINT. Everything Meta needs to match the eventual
 * Purchase to a person and a campaign is written into the order here, because
 * the webhook that fires Purchase receives only what Razorpay stores. Signals
 * not written now are gone by then: the buyer may complete inside a bank app
 * and never return to a page that could report them.
 *
 * This is ALSO the last request the buyer's own browser makes before the
 * payment sheet takes over, which makes it the only honest place to read their
 * IP and user agent. The webhook that fires Purchase is a request from
 * Razorpay, so reading those headers there would record Razorpay's server as
 * the buyer's device. See lib/request-signals.ts.
 *
 * Razorpay allows 15 note keys at 256 chars each and REJECTS the order if
 * either limit is passed. Since 2026-09-22 the record is written ONE FIELD PER
 * KEY, with two small packJsonNote bundles, rather than one JSON blob sliced
 * across ten keys: an oversized value can then only cost its own field.

     This used to be five readable keys plus `packContext`, which serialised
     twenty fields into a single JSON string and sliced it across `x0`..`x9`.

     THAT SHAPE FAILS ALL-OR-NOTHING. The slice cuts the JSON mid-string, the
     webhook's `JSON.parse` throws on the truncated text, and the handler falls
     back to an empty context: one oversized campaign name and ALL TWENTY
     fields arrive at Pabbly blank together. Which is exactly the symptom that
     sent us looking.

     Now each signal is its own key, so an oversized value can only ever cost
     its own field. The two bundles that remain are small and self-contained,
     and `packJsonNote` keeps each one valid by shortening its LONGEST value
     until it fits, never by cutting the finished JSON.

         utm_medium  = {{campaign.name}}
         utm_campaign= {{adset.name}}

         utm_content = {{ad.name}}

       READ THAT BEFORE CHANGING A CAP. Three of the five carry Meta NAMES,
       which in an agency account run to forty or sixty characters, and the
       caps were originally sized for the standard convention where source and
       medium are words like "facebook" and "paid_social". Thirty characters
       would have cut every campaign and ad name in half.

       20/55/55/55/25 serialises to 246 of the 256 available, so there are ten
       characters of margin and packJsonNote only ever has to nibble a
       genuinely unusual name.

       THE AD ID GETS 25, NOT 20 (Atul, 2026-09-22). Meta's ids are 17 to 18
       digits today and have grown over the years; at 20 this field would
       start truncating the moment they reach 21, and a truncated ad id is
       worse than a missing one because it still looks like an id and will
       quietly join to nothing. The five characters come off the placement,
       which is a short fixed vocabulary (instagram_reels, facebook_feed,
       instagram_stories) with nothing near 20. */

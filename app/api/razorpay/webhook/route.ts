/**
 * Razorpay webhook, and the ONLY place a Purchase is reported.
 *
 * A browser-side Purchase would miss every UPI payer who completes inside
 * their bank app and never returns to the tab, which in India is most of them.
 * It is also the only place the payment is proven rather than merely
 * attempted. The success handler on the checkout page navigates and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * UNLIKE the Instamojo integration this replaced, the buyer context does not
 * ride in a token on the URL: it is in the order's own `notes`, written at
 * create-order time and returned here verbatim by Razorpay. That is why this
 * route needs nothing on its query string and why the webhook URL registered
 * in the dashboard is a plain, static one.
 *
 * The signature check is not optional. Without it anyone who learns this URL
 * can post a fake payment and inflate Meta's conversion data, which then
 * teaches the ad account to buy the wrong people.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT READ HERE: this request's IP and user agent. They
 * belong to Razorpay's server, not the buyer's device. Sending them would put
 * a confidently wrong device signature on the single event where matching
 * matters most, and nothing would look broken.

  /* ── IS THIS SALE EVEN OURS? (2026-09-22) ──────────────────────────────
     A signature check proves the call came from Razorpay. It does NOT prove
     the payment came from THIS checkout.

     Razorpay registers webhooks per URL on an ACCOUNT and sends every
     subscribed event to every registered URL. So this endpoint receives every
     captured payment on the account: a second funnel sharing it, a payment
     link created by hand in the dashboard, an invoice, a renewal. Every one
     of those was being reported as a sale of this challenge, with a Purchase
     to Meta, a purchase to GA4 and a buyer row to the fulfilment hand-off.

     `notes.kind` is this funnel's mark, written on the order at create time.
     No mark, or someone else's mark, means the payment is not ours.

     200, NOT an error. A non-200 makes Razorpay retry the same foreign
     payment on a schedule for hours. This is a correct, final "not mine". */

     `payment.created_at` is the moment the money was captured, in Unix
     seconds, and it arrives on this payload. Nothing has to carry it.

     It replaces a timestamp we used to mint at create-order and ferry through
     the order notes. That one meant "when the buyer submitted the form",
     which for a UPI payer can be minutes earlier, so the two are not the same
     instant. Atul's call is that the capture time is the one the record
     should carry, and the practical gain is that it can no longer be lost:
     a note that fails to pack cannot take the sale's date with it.

     Fallback to now() only if Razorpay ever omits it, so the field is never
     empty on a row that definitely represents a real payment. */

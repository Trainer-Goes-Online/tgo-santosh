/* ══ 0 · Announcement strip ════════════════════════════════════════════════
   A slim strip with one live saffron dot and a slow shine, so it reads as
   alive rather than as a static red sale bar. It names a specific price, a
   specific anchor and a specific date, never "limited time".

   Dark oxblood rail so it pulls the eye above the light stage. Price tokens
   are saffron (7.2:1 on oxblood).

   ⚠️ FLAG FOR ATUL: "Price Increases To ₹1799 Tomorrow" is rendered verbatim
   from the copy. On an evergreen page "Tomorrow" stops being true the day
   after launch. Either the campaign carries a real dated deadline, or that
   segment needs re-wording by NO-BRAINER. Not silently changed here. */

                Phone and tablet only, directly under the headline.

                It exists because of what the two layouts do differently. From
                `lg` up the offer card sits in the right column level with the
                headline, so the screen already has its one large image and a
                second here would be a repeat. Below `lg` that card is stacked a
                long way down, so the top of a phone screen is pure type from
                the announcement bar to the CTA. This is what breaks that up.

                `lg:hidden`, not `md:hidden`: THIS grid goes two-column at `lg`
                (see the wrapper above), so the banner has to persist through
                the whole single-column range or a tablet gets the wall of type
                the phone had. Read from the wrapper, not assumed.

                `sizes="100vw"` because in this range it genuinely is the full
                width, and NO `priority`: the LCP candidate on a phone is the
                headline, and preloading a multi-megabyte banner pushes the text
                it sits under further out. */}

   Four figures on a ruled row, lifted so the card straddles the seam at the
   foot of the stage: the join is a designed object rather than a colour
   change. Both sides of that seam are light now, so the card is doing the work
   the value change used to do.

   The source copy sets these with emoji (⭐ 🛡️ 🏆). They render as
   matched-weight line icons instead: emoji as UI is the single loudest
   template tell and renders differently on every device the audience owns. The

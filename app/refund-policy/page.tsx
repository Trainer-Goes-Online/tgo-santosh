/**
 * The refund policy, written to what the client has actually stated and
 * nothing more.
 *
 * The sections that cannot be written truthfully are ABSENT rather than
 * invented. There is no "window" section and no "what is not refundable"
 * section, because stating either would mean making up a term the client has
 * never agreed, and an invented refund window reads as finished and is
 * enforceable the moment a buyer quotes it back.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CONSEQUENCE, AND IT IS A REAL ONE. The source copy promises a "100%
 * Money-Back Guarantee" five times plus "Join Risk-Free", and this page states
 * no window, no conditions and no exclusions against it. A buyer, and a card
 * network in a dispute, will read that as UNCONDITIONAL and open-ended. That is
 * the most buyer-favourable reading and the merchant carries it. It is the
 * honest consequence of publishing the guarantee without terms; the fix is not
 * wording here, it is Santosh answering: until when, on what conditions, and
 * how fast it is processed.
 *
 * What IS stated here is only what is known: the promise in the client's own
 * words, the inbox that receives requests, that refunds return to the original
 * payment method, and that bank settlement time is outside anyone's control. On
 * Razorpay the refund itself is initiated from the gateway dashboard, against
 * the payment.

      <h2>1. The guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        The {LEGAL.product} ({PRICE}) is sold with a{' '}
        <strong>100% Money-Back Guarantee</strong>. If the challenge is not
        right for you, write to us and we will refund what you paid.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How to request a refund</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Email <a href={`mailto:${LEGAL.email}`}>{LEGAL.email}</a> from the same
          address you used at checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the subject line{' '}
          <strong>&ldquo;Refund Request: 5-Day Music Therapy Practitioner Challenge&rdquo;</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Include your full name and the date of purchase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That is the whole process. You do not need to give a reason, and there is
        no form to fill in.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Processing time</h2>
      <p>
        A refund is initiated as soon as your request has been checked against
        the payment record. Once it is initiated, banks typically take 5 to 7
        business days to show the credit, which is outside our control.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Refund method</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds go back to the original payment method used at checkout: the same
        card, UPI ID or account. We cannot redirect a refund to a different
        method.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        Please email us before raising a dispute with your bank. A refund
        requested directly is handled faster, and a chargeback simply takes
        longer for everyone.
      </p>

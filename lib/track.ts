     optimised toward and seeded into a lookalike. Homemakers deliberately get
     no second event: a QualifiedLead audience that contains both answers
     cannot be targeted as one.

     ⚠️ WHICH HALF QUALIFIES IS UNCONFIRMED ON THIS FUNNEL. The source copy
     addresses homemakers and working professionals with equal weight, so
     `working_professional` is the house default rather than a stated client
     preference. Flip the test if Santosh says the other way round, and do it
     BEFORE any spend: the audience this seeds cannot be re-cut afterwards.

     dedupes on event_name + event_id, and the route derives a different id per
